            <p>Vision of this Project is to create the most secure Password Manager. You can use this app locally. Your data will be stored on the local storage of your device. You don&apos;t need to sign in, just download the app and start using. This app does not collect or send any of your data to third parties. And you have no option to back up your password if you once delete it. So make sure you have a backup before deleting the app.</p> 

            <p>Thank you for using &lt;Next Pass&gt; App</p>
